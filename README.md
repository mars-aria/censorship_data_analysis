# censorship_data_analysis
My final research project titled "What Effect Have U.S. Political Parties Had On State Censorship?" in the Data Science for Social Impact bootcamp program at Howard University. This data analysis report compares the relationships between censorship and political parties at the state-level in relation to the frequency distribution of book ban types using the PEN America dataset. As a data scholar, I investigate: do more right-wing states ban books than left-wing states and which type of ban is the most popular?
